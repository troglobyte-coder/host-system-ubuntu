# host-system-ubuntu
Ubuntu host system image for platform test.
This repository is a representation of an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS host system.

Docker is a set of platform as a service **(PaaS)** products that use
OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called
containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their
own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate
with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the
containers share the services of a single operating system kernel,
they use fewer resources than virtual machines.
